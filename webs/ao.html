				<h1>Normally Sampled Ambient Occlusion</h1>

				<h2>The Algorithm</h2>
				<p>I first learned this technique from a presentation by Inigo Quilez (though
				that original presentation is nowhere to be found, it seems.) It works by comparing
				the nearest distance to the surface at points along the surface normal with the 
				point's length along the normal, and using those values as contributions to a
				sum of how much light was occluded. Let's take a peek, shall we?</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/occlusion/full/base.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/occlusion/small/base.png' alt='Root equation' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Where <i>L</i> is the amount of occluded light, <i>s</i> is the number of
						occlusion samples, <i>d</i> is the distance function, <i>p</i> is the surface
						point, and <i>n</i> is the surface normal.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>This is a mean looking equation, so let's break it down. The first thing to note
				is that the negative exponential out front is to scale samples' contributions to
				the result by their distance from the surface (or rather their relevance). The
				subtraction is the comparison between normal distance and sampled distance.</p>
				<p>The furthest a point can be from a surface in this situation is its length along the surface
				normal beneath it. This is important; if the nearest distance is less than
				this normal distance, then some feature besides the origin surface is near the
				point. If we assume that this surface is any form opaque, then it is occluding light. This
				behavior is modelled by the distance function comparison. </p>
				<p>However, the greater the length along the surface normal, the greater gap for
				light to enter. Therefore the contribution of outer samples should be attenuated
				to suit. The negative power facilitates this.</p>

				<p>Here we see a basic ray-marched surface with a sample point and normal vector.
				Next we visualize several discrete steps along this vector.</p>

				<p>Now that it's established that we discretely step along the normal vector, let's
				examine exactly why. The figure below highlights the distance along the normal
				of each surface point.</p>

				<h2>Optimization</h2>
				<p>This technique, as written in the equation above, works well. But there's room
				to do it much faster. Let's take out a few operations.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/occlusion/full/removeZero.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/occlusion/small/removeZero.png' alt='First iter delete' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Removing the first iteration.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>At the first iteration <i>(i=0)</i> the distance along the normal is zero, and
				the distance to the nearest surface from the original marched point idealistically
				is also 0. This means that the first contribution is always 0-0, and can be removed.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/occlusion/full/removeDivide.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/occlusion/small/removeDivide.png' alt='Removing I/S divides' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Removing <i>i/s</i>
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Traditionally the surface normal is of length 1. This assumption is used here, and
				the length along the normal is considered simply to be the iteration <i>i</i> over
				the total number of iterations. However, that's a divide for a value that will always
				range from just above 0 to 1. That means we can pull out those divides and simply
				update our maximum value and iteration step.</p>

					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Removing the scaling divide.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>This step is rather obvious. To remove the division in the scale exponential,
				we negate the power.</p>

						Removing the power negation.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>As a final touch, we consider <i>s</i> now to be a negative number,
				and reverse our units, so we don't perform a negation in the scale factor.</p>
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<div class='code_snippet'>
					<p>
					/*<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculates the ambient occlusion factor at a given point in space.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses IQ's marched normal distance comparison technique.<br>
					*/<br>
					float calcOcclusion(vec3 pos, vec3 norm)<br>
					{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;float result = 1.0;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;float s = -OCC_SAMPLES;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;const float unit = 1.0/OCC_SAMPLES;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;for(float i = unit; i < 1.0; i+=unit)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result -= pow(2.0,i*s)*(i-getDist(pos+i*norm));<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;return result*OCC_FACTOR;<br>
					}<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>In implementating this function I found several changes I could make to
				simplify its contribution to the entire lighting equation.</p>
				<p>First, if I subtract each contribution down from 1.0 I can use the resultant
				value to scale the lighting result, simplifying later stages of my process.</p>
				<p>Another implementation difference is that I create a local variable for 
				<i>s</i>. This way I can still specify a positive sample amount, and also no
				longer need to worry about zany incrementation.</p>
				<p>Another facet that differs in the implementation is a final scale factor.
				This factor was present in the original implementation, but I left it out of
				my equations to avoid muddling the idea. This is used to scale the appearance
				of the effect based on how much omni-directional light is in the scene.</p>
