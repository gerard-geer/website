				<h1>3D Floor Map</h1>
				<p>WebGL is fun beans. Since it is in essence just a JavaScript object it doesn't have
				all the idiosyncrasies that traditional OpenGL implementations. There isn't multiple editions
				of GLSL to contend with, no worries about capabilities between cards and OpenGL revisions, 
				and no clunkiness in loading shaders and textures. However, to accomplish such a great feat
				of platform independence it has to dip its capabilities to nearly the least common denominator
				of hardware.</p>
				<p>What I've made here is a 3D floor map of my dormitory floor at RIT. You click on a room, and
				info about that room pops up in a small dialog. Some rooms and other entities have links in their
				info that take you to relevant information, right there in the map.
				<h2>Rendering</h2>
				<p>There are two editions of the map geometry used:
				<ul>
					<li>One which is color-coded in greyscale based on the room. This is the ID model.</li>
					<li>Another which is colored for the user to see. I'll call this the "diffuse" pass.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>These two models are rendered multiple times. First, we directly render the ID model to
				a framebuffer with a yellow background, allowing us to differentiate between clicks that are on
				and off the model with ease.
				</p>
				<p>WebGL does not allow for multiple render targets, so for each pass of a multiple-buffer rendering
				method must be done independently. This fact causes some friction in the drawing of the model.
				The final desired product is fully wire-framed, and the wire-frame and selected room are gently
				Gaussian blurred, giving an old-timey sci-fi look. I was going for (in part) the style that
				Eidos' cult-classic game Whiplash had with their map display, but with a bit more detail and 
				interactivity.) To accomplish this the rendering methodology the map uses has several steps. (On
				part of WebGL's lack of MRT support.)

					</div>
					Render the depth of the diffuse model into a framebuffer. Notice now that we have 
					all of the viewport-visible data of the model in image-space. (Including the earlier

					</div>
					Next we apply a Sobel filter to the ID, normal, and depth renders. If the value of any of these 
					at a given texel is above a certain threshhold, it is stepped up to 1 and stored in its own 
					framebuffer. This is how the wireframe is created. Also rendered into this buffer is the 
					selected room, if it exists. When we combine the wireframe with the final pass, the selected 
					room is highlighted.

				</p>
				<p>
				Yes, there is a whole lot being done here. It can even be further reduced as-is. One might criticize 
				the fact that normals are calculated in their own pass, when they can simply be derived from the 
				depth-pass framebuffer. There is a reason for doing it my way: The way  dFdx(genType g) 
				and dFdy(genType g) work is, well, 'effing cool. Fragments are processed often in 
				groups, each with their own set of registers with the GPU. These  two functions actually snoop the 
				registers of adjacent fragments for the state of the variable passed to them, and returns the difference 
				between the local and snooped copy of the variable. That's wicked.
				</p>
				<h2>Interaction</h2>
				<p>
				Compared to the rendering of the map, interaction is rather straightforward. The user clicks somewhere on
				the screen. The location of the click is taken and transformed by the view-frustum of the ID pass, and
				then the transformed coordinates are used to read directly out of the ID pass framebuffer. Since the
				background in this pass is yellow, we know that if the values of the red and blue channels don't match,
				the user clicked outside the model. If they do, we send the red value to the info-popup dialog callback
				as the ID of the room to display.
				</p>
				<p>Info for the room is queried from an LDAP database maintained by members of the dormitory floor.</p>
