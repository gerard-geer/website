				<h1>A Simple Ray-Marching Camera Function</h1>
				<p>When I first started ray-marching something I found right
				away was TekF's <a href='https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdsGDB'>polar camera.</a> It's
				 elegant, very good at shooting scenes where the camera
				need not move, and had a parametrization that, while hefty, 
				made sense.</p>
				<p>However, as time went on I started feeling like the TekF
				solution was a bit too much for my needs; I just wanted a
				camera function that needs and does as little as possible to
				give me a ray origin and direction.</p>
				<p>The answer I came up with is based around the classic pinhole
				camera where the ray origin is at some focal distance<i>f</i> 
				behind the screen, and the ray direction is just the
				pixel's position at the screen <i>(u, v, 0)</i> minus the ray 
				origin, normalized. But let's think: That approach relies heavily on
				the <i>standard</i> coordinate system; you know, the 3-dimensional
				space based around x, y and z.
				Now what if we were to define the origin and direction in such a way
				that to translate and rotate the camera, we only need to specify our 
				own vectors as the axes of the three dimensions?</p>
				<p>In linear algebra, this is essentially a change of basis, with
				some translation encoded in there too. To start, let's think of 
				what the camera would consider to be its principle axes:
				<ul>
					<li>A vector that points up out of the camera would be its Y-axis.</li>
					<li>The camera direction--or rather the direction the camera faces--
					inherently points along the camera-relative Z-axis.</li>
					<li>The cross product of the camera direction and the UP vector
					would point orthogonally to the right of the camera, becoming
					an implicit X-axis in the process.</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>Remember that the original UV coordinates and the distance the
				focal point is stepped back from the screen are simply multiples of
				the standard X, Y, and Z basis vectors. Now should we re-imagine our 
				coordinate basis for the camera, if we think of these things in
				terms of our new basis vectors, we implicitly perform camera 
				translation and orientation.</p>
				<p>Recall the ray origin of the standard pinhole camera to be <i>(0, 0, -f)</i>,
				and that the original pixel coordinates were <i>(u, v, 0)</i>. A way
				of thinking about this is:</p>

						<div class='image_text'>
						Where x, y, and z are vectors representing the standard 
						axial directions: <i>(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0),</i> and <i>(0, 0, 1)</i>.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Now that 3-D coordinate right there is essentially the origin
				of the camera, so:</p>

					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Yep kids, that point behind the screen is actually the origin of
						the vector space the rays exist in.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Really though, being the camera / ray origin makes it the camera
				position.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/camera/full/standardbasisposition.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/camera/small/standardbasisposition.png' alt='Standard basis equation rewritten ... again' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Okay, so that really means it's the camera position.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Now let's go ahead and rewrite this equation in terms of our new
				basis vectors:</p>

					<a href='img/prj/camera/full/redefinedbasis.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/camera/small/redefinedbasis.png' alt='Screenshot' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Note how x, y, and z have been replaced.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>It's as simple as that.To get the ray direction, you simply normalize 
				the subtraction of the ray origin
				from the pixel position, and the ray origin is simply the camera position.</p>
				<p>And with that you have a pinhole camera that you can easily position,
				in what can be reduced to two lines of GLSL:</p>
				<div class='code_snippet'>
					<p>
					/*<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;A change-of-basis pinhole camera.<br>
					*/<br>
					void camera(in vec2 uv, in vec3 cp, in vec3 cd, in float f, out vec3 ro, out vec3 rd)<br>
					{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;ro = cp;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;normalize((cp + cd*f + cross(cd, UP)*uv.x + UP*uv.y)-ro);<br>
					}<br>
					</p>
