				<h1>Fast Surface Normal Generation</h1>
				<p>When one draws computer graphics the traditional way, using all of the rendering
				pipeline, it's easy to include surface orientation data right alongside other vertex
				data.</p>
				<p>However when ray-marching one calculates geometry on the fly, and hence can't be
				buddied-up with pre-computed surface normals. How then does one calculate a surface normal?</p>
				<p>After a while I thought to take the negative reciprocal of the local derivative (essentially
				a Sobel filtering) to create a vector that pointed out of the surface, and hence could
				be the surface normal. However, that takes a ton of sampling and division, both very
				time-heavy operations. Then I stumbled upon this gem.</p>
				<div class='code_snippet'>
					<p>
					/*<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns the surface normal of a point in the distance function.<br>
					*/<br>
					vec3 getNormal(vec3 pos)<br>
					{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;float d=getDist(pos);<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;return normalize(vec3( getDist(pos+vec3(EPSILON,0,0))-d, getDist(pos+vec3(0,EPSILON,0))-d, getDist(pos+vec3(0,0,EPSILON))-d ));<br>
					}<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Whoa, what is this mess? Let's refactor it for readability.</p>
				<div class='code_snippet'>
					<p>
					/*<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns the surface normal of a point in the distance function.<br>
					*/<br>
					vec3 getNormal(vec3 pos)<br>
					{<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;float c=getDist(pos);<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;vec3 n = vec3();<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;n.x = getDist( pos+vec3(EPSILON,0,0) );<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;n.y = getDist( pos+vec3(0,EPSILON,0) );<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;n.z = getDist( pos+vec3(0,0,EPSILON) );<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;n - c;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;return normalize(n);<br>
					}<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>That's more expensive, but fathoms more pleasant to read. First, some clarification.
				This function relies on some predefined tokens. EPSILON is the maximum acceptable distance
				threshold, and getDist() is the distance function. Normalize() is a built-in to normalize
				a vector type.
				To understand what's going on here, let's step down into two dimensions and draw pictures. 
				Here's a point that we've marched to the surface of a distance function.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>

						The red dot is a point marched to the surface of a distance function.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Now remember that point does not exist
				exactly upon the surface, but rather has been marched to within a minimum distance (that we 
				call epsilon) of the distance function. So if we zoom in by a great amount...</p>

						A close up of the prior figure.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>There are two important things to notice about this figure. First is the afore mentioned
				discontinuity in marched position versus actual position, and second, that at this scale
				nearly all surfaces approach linear gradients.</p>
				<p>If we look at the function, we see that it samples the distance function epsilon away
				from the original point along the positive direction of each axis. Let's do that in our
				2D illustration--first we do this along the X axis.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/sampledatx.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/normals/small/sampledatx.png'alt='sampling along the x axis' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Sampling the distance function epsilon along the X axis. The new distance is represented
						by the purple line, with the original distance typified by the blue line, with the
						dotted green line being epsilon distance along the X axis.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Next we need to subtract the original distance from the value along the X axis. This will give
				us the magnitude of our normal vector in the X direction.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/subtractedx.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/normals/small/subtractedx.png'alt='subtracting original dist' width='600'>
					</a>
					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Subtracting the original distance from the freshly sampled distance. The subtracted portion
						is now dotted.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>The next step is to sample the distance function epsilon along the Y axis away
				from the original point.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/sampledaty.png' target='_blank'>

					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Sampling the distance function epsilon along the Y axis. This value is represented
						by the yellow line, with the translation epsilon along the Y axis drawn out in 
						dotted green.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Again we subtract epsilon from this sampled distance, and this time we
				arrive at the magnitude of the Y component of our normal vector.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/subtractedy.png' target='_blank'>

					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Subtracting the original distance. The dotted portion of the yellow line is
						the result of our work.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Now if we were to construct a vector using these terms, this is what we would arrive at.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>
					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/normalconstructed.png' target='_blank'>

					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Constructing a perpendicular vector, using the remaining portions of the distance
						values.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>It's important to note that this vector is merely perpendicular to the surface.
				It still needs to be normalized to be considered a normal vector.</p>
				<p>For those who like this kind of thing, here's a pretty LaTeX representation.</p>
				<div class='image_and_text'>		
					<p>
					<div class='image'>

					<a href='img/prj/normals/full/normalization.png' target='_blank'>
						<img src='img/prj/normals/small/normalization.png'alt='interpolation function' width='600'>

					</div>
						<div class='image_text'>
						Where <i>S</i> is the perpendicular vector, <i>d</i> is the distance function,
						epsilon is the sampling distance, <i>p</i> is the original point, and <i>N</i>
						is the surface normal.
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>An interesting facet of this technique is the fact that we sample distances
				to surface points that are not that of the original. This requires that the region
				being sampled has negligible change in gradient for accurate results. Therefore,
				if epsilon were large enough to span a significant change in slope, the results
				of this technique would be garbled.</p>
				<p>Epsilon, or the maximum acceptable distance, is always linked to the
				accuracy of spacial representation. This technique then, with its above downfall,
				additionally ties epsilon's precision with the accuracy of scene lighting and
				any other effect that relies upon accurate surface orientation.</p>
				<p>Something else to think about: What if the original distance was 0.0, and our 
				original point actually did exist upon the geometry? What if the gradient between
				sample positions was guaranteed to be linear, or at least guaranteed to be safe
				to assume so? What if we were using traditional rendering techniques, and were
				working with real fragments with access to dfdx() and dfdy()? What if?</p>
